</center> <p><strong>A Modern Family Book</strong>, The untold oral history of one of television�s groundbreaking sitcoms by marc freeman is an excellent inside look at the show told in a wonderfully personal manner.

<h3 id="19-photo-book-cover-examples-templates-amp-design-ideas">19+ Photo Book Cover Examples, Templates &amp; Design Ideas</h3><p>He doesn�t have the perfect family. While the focus is squarely on modern family and its cast and crew, readers curious about the making of tv shows in general, and network sitcoms in particular, will find plenty to interest them, including the process of casting a show, the mechanics of a “table read,” the construction of a temporary set, and the designing of a title. The untold oral history of one of television�s groundbreaking sitcoms is the only major book ever written that explores this show as told by those who created it. Books about television shows (or movies, or music acts) can easily get bogged down in either superfluous praise (no matter how deserved) or petty gossip. For me this book was a quick, and fun read. 2.1 out of 5 stars.</p>
