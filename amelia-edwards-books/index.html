<p>Temples, tombs and hieroglyphs is always the first book i recommend. A fascinating glimpse into a time when britain was �great� and the empire still strong. The subject of this book is a woman who exercised a decisive influence on the history of egyptology; Edwards was educated at home by her mother, showing considerable promise as a writer at a young age.</p>
<h3 id="books-and-art-untrodden-peaks-and-unfrequented-valleys">Books and Art Untrodden Peaks and Unfrequented Valleys</h3><p>The writer amelia edwards travelled to egypt in autumn 1873, to escape the rain on a walking holiday in france. I promised myself i�d read the book and glad i did. As enthralling as any work of fiction, a thousand miles up the nile is the quintessential victorian travel book. At a very early age she displayed considerable literary and artistic talent. She published her first poem at the age of 7, her first story at age 12. Education edwards was educated at home by her mother and showed considerable promise as a writer at a young age.</p>
