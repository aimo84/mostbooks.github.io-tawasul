</center> <p><strong>An Obtuse Angle Looks Like A Book That Is More</strong>, In other words, an obtuse angle is an angle between a right angle and a straight angle. Acute and obtuse triangles are the. Right (90°) right angles are always measured at 90.</p>

<center>An acute angle looks like a book that is more &gt; From akzamkowy.org</center>
<p>Hence, all angles that lie in the range of 90° to 180° are obtuse angles. An obtuse angle looks like this: This means the angle sum property for any triangle remains the same. And the two straight sides are called arms.</p>
<h3 id="an-acute-angle-looks-like-a-book-that-is-more-gt">An acute angle looks like a book that is more &gt;</h3><p>From the figure, it is noted that the smaller angle is called the obtuse angle, and the larger angle formed is called the reflex angle. The corner point of an angle is called the vertex. So that suggests that this might be a set phrase. An angle that is less than 90° is known to be an acute angle. There are two main ways to label angles: Half a circle is equal to 180 degrees (a straight angle).</p>
