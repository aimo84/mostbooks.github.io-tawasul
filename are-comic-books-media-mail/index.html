</center> <p><strong>Are Comic Books Media Mail</strong>, This is recommened for when sending in 30 books to cgc at one time on one invoice.

You can place 3 of these inside a box that is 14x14x6 in size. $5 for 12 books, or $10 for up to 50 books. You are certainly not violating the spirit of the law by shipping comic books via media mail. Regardless of the legality of using media mail, my concern is that media mail is so rough on comics.</p>
