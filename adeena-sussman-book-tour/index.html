<p>Her second cookbook, shabbat, will be published by penguin/avery in spring 2023. Fresh, sunny flavors from my israeli kitchen (avery, $35), philadelphia had to be on her agenda. Adeena sussman�s first solo cookbook, sababa, was released by penguin/avery books in september 2019 and was named a best fall cookbook by the new york times, bon appétit, and food &amp; wine. We should all be cooking like adeena sussman.</p>
<h3 id="join-toi-community-for-culinary-conversation-with-cookbook">Join ToI Community for culinary conversation with cookbook</h3><p>Baker sarah owens is here to talk about starters, starting over, and her new book, heirloom: Her second cookbook, shabbat, will be published by penguin/avery in spring 2023. If you’re out of your favorite steak seasoning, try rubbing your meat with turkish coffee. First up, a treat for all of you sourdough and fermentation fans out there. A friend of chef michael solomonov, sussman, along with her book, will be the star attraction during a special breakfast at solomonov’s restaurant. It’s a life of pancakes that remind you of blueberry pie, eating onion dip with your glam squad, banana bread that breaks the internet, and a little something called pad thai carbonara.</p>
