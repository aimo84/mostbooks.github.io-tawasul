<p>My life, my tapes” after about ten years! Extrapolated from how cooper was depicted in the television show (prior to the recent third series), the book follows the fbi agent through his life and i would argue the narrative is mostly in harmony with what is shown on tv.

The book is definitely not a masterpiece, but an enjoyable read nevertheless.</p>
