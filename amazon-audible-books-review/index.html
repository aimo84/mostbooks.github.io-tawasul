It�s an amazon company, so you get added bonuses if you�re a prime member too. For a little under $15 a month, i could gain access to the world’s largest collection of audiobook content, plus get some other nifty extras that, at the time, seemed tempting too. Then about three years ago, i discovered audible, amazon’s audiobook subscription service and marketplace that allows subscribers to listen to books anywhere they go. Not only is audible’s audiobook selection larger, but it is also more diverse compared to many other services. A pair of shoes we don’t really need.</p>
