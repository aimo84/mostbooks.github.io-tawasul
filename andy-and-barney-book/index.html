<h3 id="andy-griffith-show-tv-show-andy-barney-opie">Andy Griffith Show TV Show Andy Barney Opie</h3><p>Sometimes, in the process of teaching the bible, we may quite effectively use an incident from a television show, a book, or real life to illustrate a biblical point. (the next morning andy comes in and finds barney slouched over in the chair at his desk and shakes him awake, and gets a good wiff) andy: Andy is a young boy who only appeared in barney�s musical castle. The andy griffith show is a classic tv show from the 60s and one that people still watch. Malcolm overhears the conversation, feels humiliated, and leaves in the middle of the night. After barney makes a complete nuisance of himself to all of mayberry, andy realizes that the answer may be to make the motorcycle more valuable to the town than to barney.</p>
