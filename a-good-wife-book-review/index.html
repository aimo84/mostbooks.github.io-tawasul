<p>.patty dickerson is a wonderful character, and this novel is astonishing.” ―the washington post book world I will have to say that i have been a fan of lawyer shows for some time and boston legal is way up there as one of my favourites. As can be expected from a jane porter novel, the good wife is an absolute hit. Marta does escape, but confusion reigns until the very end and, although the ending may disappoint some, for this reader it confirms chapman’s skill at writing a novel that is both prophetic and ironic.</p>
<h3 id="my-lovely-wife-by-samantha-downing-book-review-by-jordana">My Lovely Wife by Samantha Downing. Book review by Jordana</h3><p>It’s a solid, if not unspectacular novel, with some well placed twists but not enough twist to overcome a plot that has been done a lot of the years. A review copy was provided for an honest review. The narration of this novel makes for a highly entertaining read. As a fan of historical fiction, i loved the good wife of bath. The good wife is a much better show than boston legal in my opinion. The heroine, melanie, did not strike me as a good wife.</p>
