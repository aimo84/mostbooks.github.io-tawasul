Personally, i would’ve liked the books to cover more after the war and how the animorphs struggle with ptsd and the way the war has shaped their lives. Chances are that today’s readers haven’t heard of it, so for those of you out there, animorphs was a popular children’s book series published. This power is granted them by a dying andalite alien named elfangor, who also warns the teens that earth is being threatened secretly by a group of aliens called yeerks. The animorphs covers were just plain eerie wikipedia the best part of getting a new installment of the animorphs books was that the cover art would always feature the narrator morphing into an animal of some sort, usually the animal they acquired for the featured mission in the book. Applegate’s animorphs series of books, which ran from 1996 through 2001.</p>
