<center>Book Review ‘n’ Blog Tour Go Home, Afton Author_Iris From authoririschacon.com</center>
<p>The company sent this cautionary email pretty soon after we first contacted the scammers: It seems myafton.com is a free booking agency that operates across the us with local venues to book shows and will pay a certain amount per person that shows up directly to the band. That was probably because the show i was on for fell apart and was a complete disaster. Here�s the body of the email i emailed you a while back to see if you�d be interested in playing some of my shows.</p>
<h3 id="book-review-n-blog-tour-go-home-afton-author_iris">Book Review ‘n’ Blog Tour Go Home, Afton Author_Iris</h3><p>Afton artists have reported that people are posting on social media that they are booking an afton show (when in reality they have no affiliation with our company). As far as sketchy con artists preying on musicians go, skunk radio live is a new one to me. But we had to settle for 1 night outside rainier and a split reservation for the other 3 nights. To be completely honest we wouldnt know what it is like booking a show ourselves but the way afton does it seems like a huge scam. We�re in about 40 cities right now and i wanted to reach out again to see if you. Afton is the first and only nationwide booking agency that books local &amp; regional independent musicians without ever being pay to play.</p>

<p>The Silver Eyes Graphic Novel (William Afton) Graphic, Most times bands sell tickets for a show and they only keep $1 or $2 from each ticket sold. Do not book on this website!!
